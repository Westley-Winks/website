## Overview

This is my personal website and my little corner of the internet. Over the years, it has really functioned as my personal learning grounds. It gave me a space to try out new stuff like coding and writing.

I wanted to give [Astro](https://astro.build) a try and I enjoyed building this revision. I'm using vanilla CSS for styling and GitHub pages for hosting.
